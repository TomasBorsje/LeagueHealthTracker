# LeagueHealthTracker
A small project that tracks your health in League of Legends &amp; plots it when the game is done. Can easily be adapted to track other statistics instead.

### How to use:

Run the executable with your league client open and in-game.
The program will track your health and max health then generate
a plot once the game ends.
